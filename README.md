## 🚀 Overview

This project is a complete reimaginig of the standard developer portfolio. Instead of a static resume, it offers an immersive **"Operating System"** experience where users navigate through a simulated terminal environment. It balances a distinct **hacker aesthetic** with modern, responsive web design principles.

The application features a fully functional command-line interface simulation, window management, and complex interactive components that showcase frontend engineering capabilities.
